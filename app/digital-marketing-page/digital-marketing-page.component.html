              <p class="profile-description text-justify">
                In 2018, we had the opportunity to work with a heritage pharmaceutical brand that had been around for several decades. They began as a contract manufacturer for topical creams and solutions, 
                but were looking to establish a new line of own-brand generic drugs to capitalize on their strong distribution networks 
                with clinics and hospitals. Not only did we help them to build a web application for their medication ordering and inventory management, 
                but they also engaged us to help them grow their presence online.

              We sat down with the key management and their sales representatives to better 
              understand how they might tailor their online content to be more relevant to their intended audiences. 
              We began by understanding their unique selling propositions, their intended target audiences, 
              as well as their closest competitors. <br />

              This formed the basis of our research, enabling us to develop keywords that would help their brand to appear more 
              frequently whenever potential customers were searching for similar terms. Once we had developed this map, 
              we then worked with their marketing department to optimize their online content, both on and off-site to align 
              their brand with the keywords frequently searched by their target audiences. Over the course of 6 months, 
              we repeated this process of testing and optimizing their digital content. <br />

              Within a year of working with us, the company not only saw a 300% increase in inbound traffic to their site, 
              but sales across their various brands also rose by 65%. Not only that, but through the process of testing and 
              optimizing, we helped them discover and refine what really mattered about their brand to their target audiences.
